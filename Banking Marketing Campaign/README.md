# Project-at-MIT-
This is my first project 

The project dataset is from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing

Project Aim: The aim of this project is to dig deep into the dataset to identify the possible reasons that correlate or contribute to the bank marketing campaign “subscribe deposit” number. 

Multiple Regression analysis will be applied in this dataset to identify the relationship between the dependent variable deposit and the rest of the independent variables and how one variable affects the other.

R-squared value 21.1% less than 50% might looks a little bit lower , however when it comes to predict human behavior like this case, it can be accepted (Frost, 2018).
